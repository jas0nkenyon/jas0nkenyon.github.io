Hi, I'm Jason. I'm currently a mathematics student <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/">Binghamton University</a>.
I am interested in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and malware analysis. My goal is to enter the
industry as a penetration tester after I graduate. On this page, I document my journey in the form of
CTF writeups and miscellaneous blog articles covering topics I find particularly interesting.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
